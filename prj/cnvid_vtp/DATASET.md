We provide the following files:

* cn_vid3_5m_v1.csv: This CSV contains all of the CNVid video urls.

* caption.json: This json file contains the captions for all the CNVid videos. It is stored as a dictionary where each key is a video_id.
Each value of the dictionary is another dictionary with the keys ['text', 'start', 'end'] where the value of 'text' is a list of all the captions from the given video_id,
and 'start' and 'end' are arrays correspondings to the start and end time timestamp of the captions (in second).
