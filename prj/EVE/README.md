# EVE: Efficient zero-shot text-based Video Editing with Depth Map Guidance and Temporal Consistency Constraints

This repository contains codebase, the ZVE-50 dataset, and editing demos for our paper: [EVE: Efficient zero-shot text-based Video Editing with Depth Map Guidance and Temporal Consistency Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17797).

## What is EVE?

EVE is a robust and efficient zero-shot video editing method. Under the guidance of depth maps and temporal consistency constraints, EVE derives satisfactory video editing results with an affordable computational and time cost. Moreover, EVE constructs a new benchmark named ZVE-50 dataset. Extensive experiments validate that EVE achieve a satisfactory trade-off between performance and efficiency.


## Codebase

We are preparing codebase and data annotations, which will be available soon.
